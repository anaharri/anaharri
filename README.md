#### Hi there! 👋
## I'm Ana, but my friends call me Harry. Welcome!


### 🙋🏻‍♀️ Who I am

A full-stack web developer with a strong inclination towards frontend development and design.
A unique combination of a colorful, creative, artistic soul, and an obsessive Capricorn-head who cannot stand to see a text with the wrong alignment. 🤦🏻‍♀️

> Pronouns: she/her


### 👩🏻‍🎓 What I've learned so far

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Node
- NPM
- Express
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- SQL & Sequelize

These are some of the main technologies I've used for the projects you're about to see. However, I look forward to learning more and more about software development and UI design, working with and for inspiring people, and discovering new technologies. 



### 🌱 Where I am
I am currently a Tech Lead / Frontend dev at [Henry] (https://www.soyhenry.com/)... but not for much longer! Soon I will become a bootcamp instructor, which I'm super excited about 🥳 
Also, because I always want to know more, I'm diving deep into algorithms and data structures with JavaScript, while coding, at the same time, a nice React app for our students at Henry.



### 🚀 Where I'm headed

My main goal at this point is to sharpen both my tech knowledge and my soft skills in order to improve as an instructor. Aside from teaching or studying, I hope to have time to work on some personal projects.







Anyways, come in, check out my work, and feel free to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-harrington/). I'm always open to receiving helpful feedback and having nerdy conversations 🤓
