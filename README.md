#### Hi there! 👋
## I'm Ana, but my friends call me Harry. Welcome!


### 🙋🏻‍♀️ Who I am

A full-stack web developer with a strong inclination towards frontend development and design.
A unique combination of a colorful, creative, artistic soul, and an obsessive Capricorn-head who cannot stand to see a text with the wrong alignment. 🤦🏻‍♀️

> Pronouns: she/her


### 👩🏻‍🎓 What I've learned so far

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Node
- NPM
- Express
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- SQL & Sequelize

These are some of the main technologies I've used for the projects you're about to see. However, I look forward to learning more and more about software development and UI design, working with and for inspiring people, and discovering new technologies. 



### 🌱 Where I am
I am currently working on the final project of my bootcamp. I can't reveal too much for now 🤭 but I can tell you this: it involves NFTs, it will be complete soon, and we are having a ton of fun building it. Stay tuned! 📺



### 🚀 Where I'm headed

I hope to have time in the next few months, before 2021 is over, to: 
- Sharpen my web design skills,
- master Figma,
- start learning a new programming language (I'm looking at you, Go).







Anyways, come in, check out my projects, and feel free to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-harrington/). I'm always open to receiving helpful feedback and having nerdy conversations 🤓
